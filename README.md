Objective:

The goal of this project was to build a simple machine learning model using Teachable Machine to classify images into two categories: Batman and Catwoman. The model was exported and used with TensorFlow.js or in a Python environment to test predictions.

⸻

Tools & Materials Used:
•	Teachable Machine (Google) – for creating and training the model
•	Webcam or Image Uploads – to collect and classify data
•	Two Classes – Batman and Catwoman
•	Exported Model (TensorFlow) – for integration
•	Google Colab / Python (optional) – to run and test predictions on images

⸻

What We Did:
1.	Created a new Image Project in Teachable Machine.
2.	Collected and uploaded images for each class (Batman and Catwoman).
3.	Trained the model using Teachable Machine’s web interface.
4.	Exported the model in TensorFlow format (for web or Python use).
5.	Tested the model by:
	•	Uploading a new image (e.g., a photo of Catwoman).
	•	Running the model in Google Colab using Python and TensorFlow to classify the image.

⸻

Skills Applied:
•	Image classification using machine learning
•	Dataset collection and labeling
•	Model training and export
•	Basic usage of TensorFlow in Python or browser
•	Understanding classification confidence and prediction output
